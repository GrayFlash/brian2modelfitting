Model fitting
-------------

The ``brian2modelfitting`` offers model fitting package, that allows for data driven optimization of custom
models.

The toolbox allows the user to find the best fit of the parameters for recorded traces and
spike trains. Just like Brian the Model Fitting Toolbox is designed to be easily used and
save time through automatic parallelization of the simulations using code generation.
